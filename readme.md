# Halo CE: Menu Screen Simulator

## Remake of the Halo CE Menu Screen in browser

### [Live Preview](https://HaloCE.Men/u/)

### Why?

- Why not? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Just experimenting seeing how close one could get

### Cons / Missing features:

- No instructions, but hopefully intuitive enough to not require them
- Not mobile responsive, but could be made to be (on the campaign / multiplayer screens 1 or 2 cards shown rather than 3)
- No gamepad integration, but again could be
- Missing certain screens like gametype, but they're basically just a clone of the campaign / multiplayer screens so couldn't be bothered
